# tmux-autopane
a tiny tool for creating pre-defined tile layouts in tmux on linux with xdotool

Initial concept of supported layouts:
- 1l1r (one left, one right)
- 1l2r (one left, two right)
- 2l1r (two left, one right)
- 1u1d (one up, one down)
- 1u2d (on up, two down)
- 2u1d (two up, one down)
- tiles = 2l2r = 2u2d (4 tiles in each corner)
